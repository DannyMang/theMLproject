What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to improve their performance on a specific task through experience. In other words, ML allows computers to learn and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
Key Concepts in Machine Learning

Data: The foundation of any ML system. Machine learning algorithms learn from data, which can include text, numbers, images, videos, or any other form of information that can be digitally stored and processed.
Features: The individual measurable properties or characteristics of the phenomena being observed. In ML, we use features to make predictions or decisions.
Models: Mathematical representations of real-world processes. ML models are trained on data to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.
Training: The process of teaching a model to make predictions or decisions by showing it many examples.
Inference: Using a trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Types of Machine Learning

Supervised Learning: The algorithm learns from labeled training data. It's like learning with a teacher who provides the correct answers.
Unsupervised Learning: The algorithm learns from unlabeled data, trying to find patterns or structures on its own.
Reinforcement Learning: The algorithm learns by interacting with an environment, receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
